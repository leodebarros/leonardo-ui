# LeonardoUI – Expo UI Components

Welcome to [LeonardoUI](https://github.com/leodebarros/leonardo-ui), a growing set of React Native components built specifically for **Expo** applications. This repository is based on [Expo](https://expo.dev) and created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:
   - A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can begin developing by editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
